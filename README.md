## Script to upgrade JADX core for ShowJava, an Android decompiler for android

## Problem

`show-java` is a great app to decompile other Android apps on the fly. However, its built based on the JaDX core. JaDX is the desktop version and its actively maintained.

## Solution

I have written a script to update the core so that `show-java` can be built with the latest core and function properly when decompiling apps. 


## jadx-sparse-core-checkout.sh

	#!/bin/sh

	jadx_core_rep=https://github.com/skylot/jadx.git
	tmp_path=tmp
	src_path=($tmp_path "jadx-core" "src" "main" "java" "jadx")
	dest_path=("app" "src" "main" "java")

	mkdir $tmp_path
	cd "$tmp_path$ds"
	git init
	git remote add -f origin $jadx_core_rep
	git pull origin master

	src_path=$(printf '%s/' "${src_path[@]%/}" )
	dest_path=$(printf '%s/' "${dest_path[@]%/}" )

	cd ..

	rm -r "${dest_path}jadx"

	mv -v $src_path $dest_path

	rm -rf "$tmp_path"
